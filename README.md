# RapGen

This repo contains a rap generator based on Word2Vec and its extension, Doc2Vec. These are shallow neural nets trained against a corpus of popular rap songs, specially designed to provide context of words and their paragraphical structure. The hope is to reconstruct rhyme scheme, syllable consistency, and stanza lengths. A stretch goal will be to encompass choral sections.
